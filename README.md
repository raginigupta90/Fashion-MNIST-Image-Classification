# Fashion MNIST Image Classification
# Overview

This project classifies fashion items (like shirts, shoes, bags) from the Fashion MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It helps in understanding image classification concepts and can be extended for e-commerce product categorization.

# Features

Classifies 10 fashion categories (e.g., T-shirt, Dress, Sneaker).

Uses CNN for high accuracy.

Visualizes training accuracy and loss curves.

Supports prediction on custom images.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV

# How It Works

Load the Fashion MNIST dataset (60,000 training & 10,000 test images).

Preprocess data (normalize and reshape images).

Train CNN model for multi-class classification.

Evaluate accuracy and test on unseen images.

Usage
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fashion-MNIST-Classification.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd Fashion-MNIST-Classification

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train the model
python train_model.py

# Test the model
python predict.py

# Results

Achieved ~90% test accuracy.

Robust performance across multiple classes.

Future Enhancements

Deploy as a web app using Flask/Streamlit.

Add data augmentation to improve model generalization.

Implement transfer learning for higher accuracy.
